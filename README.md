EssentialLaTeX
==============

Scope
-----
"Essential LaTeX" is a narrow scope LaTeX introduction, intended for contributors to technical manuals or tutorials.  As such, it doesn't touch upon an area where LaTeX really shines, i.e., typesetting mathematical formulas.  It only scratches the surface of many other aspects of LaTeX as well, for (much) more details, one should refer to the excellent Guide to LaTeX by Kopka and Daly.


Typesetting
-----------
It is straightforward to produce the PDF version of this document using the provided GNU Make file.  If you have LaTeX installed on your system, simply type:
$ make

This approach is recommended for new users since the document requires a number of typesetting passes since both BibTeX and makeindex are used.

Note however that the source code of the document is as much part of the tutorial, since it (obviously) provides examples of all concepts introduced in the text.
